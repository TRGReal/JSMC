# JSMC
A simple NodeJS Minecraft replica server using raw TCP.

**Files have been used from PrismarineJS's libraries but they have not been used to initiate the connection with the Minecraft client.**
The dimensions codec and dimensions list in the Join Game packet have been taken from the minecraft-data library (https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data/).

Licensing probably won't be added until it's needed, please contact me if you wish to use this project and require me to add a license (my Discord is TRGReal#5700).
