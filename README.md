# JSMC
A simple NodeJS Minecraft replica server using raw TCP.

**Files have been used from PrismarineJS's libraries but they have not been used to initiate the connection with the Minecraft client.**
The dimensions codec and dimensions list in the Join Game packet have been taken from the minecraft-data library (https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data/).
